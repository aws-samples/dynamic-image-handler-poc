# Dyamic Image Handler PoC

## About

This is a PoC created to support dynamic image rendition with an image resize support. Additional features can be added as required in the future. This is developed based on the Sharp opensource framework. This application can be used as a standalone NodeJS app running in EC2 or containerize it.

## Install Prerequisites

- Git
- Node JS v14 or above
- npm v6 or above
- Create an IAM Role with access to the source and destination S3 buckets. Attach that role to the user used to access S3 from local

## App Build

### Local setup

Clone the source code  
From the source root directory, run the below commands

##### Install the dependencies

```
npm install
```

##### Setup ESLint

```
npm init @eslint/config
```

##### Local build

```
npm run build
```

##### Local run

```
npm run start
```

### Server setup

CDK deployment - This will install VPC, Subnets, NAT Gateway, ALB, ASG, EC2 launch configuration. Cloudfront deployment is not included in this stack. Please set it up manually if required. If deplpoying into GovCloud, you can utilize commercial CloudFront with GovCloud Origin as described here - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/setting-up-cloudfront.html

NOTE: This deploymet doesn't add HTTPS certificates to ALB. Uses HTTP by default. Please modify the script to add HTTPS support for actual app implementation.


#####  Install latest cdk version

```
npm install -g aws-cdk
```


#####  Make sure you are in source root directory.

>Goto `constructs` directory to access CDK scripts 

```
cd constructs
```

#####  Install and build the cdk scripts

```
npm i
npm run build
```

##### Execute below CDK commands to deploy the infrastructure and the application

```
cdk bootstrap

cdk synth

```

##### Once you verify the synth output, deploy the stack using

```
cdk deploy
```

NOTE: This should deploy all the required infra components and the application. Use ALB DNS URL to verify the application. Use postman to process the image. Make sure, you pass the appropriate S3 bucket and image to succesfully process the images.


#### Cleanup 

!!!Note Make sure to remove all the policies from the role before running destroy

```
//List the role
aws iam list-roles | jq -r '.Roles[] | select(.RoleName|match("DIH-CDK-Stack-EC2IAMRole."))'

// Copy the full rolename (role-name)
// "RoleName" :

//List attached policy
aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name $role-name

// Copy Policy ARN (policy-arn)
//"AttachedPolicies"

//Detach the policies attached to the role
aws iam detach-role-policy --role-name $role-name --policy-arn $policy-arn

```

###### Stack cleanup   

```bash
$ cdk destroy
```
